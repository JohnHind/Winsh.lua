Generating the Published (read only) version of the documentation TiddlyWiki.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The internal SaveAs function no longer works, so must process the file manually:

1. Copy the source file to a new file.
2. Find and edit the "Imprint" tiddler. Add the tag "$$!published!" to its tags.
3. Find and delete all tiddlers tagged "excludePublished".
4. Save and close the file.
5. Open the file in a text editor.
6. In the "versionArea" script section near the top of the file, edit the title "TiddlyWiki" to "TW".
7. Save and close the file - it should now reopen in a browser as a read-only published version.

NB: Step 6 prevents the TiddlySaver plugin for FireFox from bothering the user for permission
to inject saver code into this file. Issue raised on GitHub - hopefully Jeremy will fix at some
point.
